# Day 11: Form Validation

## Explorer Mode

* It's not in the form image anywhere, but include a "submit" button for the user to submit their form
* When the user submits their form, you should run a function that validates their input.
* If their input is invalid, you must somehow inform the user that they need to fill out more information. You can be very generic in this message.
* If their input is valid, put the input in an object and print that object to the console.

##  Notes
Don't worry about styles until you've completed Explorer mode! I recommend starting by just making a form with only one input, and validating that one input. Once you've got that working, you can add another element and validate that new one.
